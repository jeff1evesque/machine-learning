#  @filesystem, an event that fires after all filesystems have mounted
start on filesystem

## block all jobs until the 'post-stop' event from this corresponding job has completed
#     (short-lived). When the 'task' directive is absent, then all other jobs are blocked
#     until the 'starting' event has completed (longer-lived).
task

## until successful mount, sleep with 1s delay, then emit 'vagrant-mounted' event
#
#  @-q, run 'mountpoint' silently
#  @--no-wait, do not wait for the emit command to finish
#  @MOUNTPOINT, specifies the environment variable to be included with the 'emit' event, where
#      [key=value] being [MOUNTPOINT=${mountpoint}]. This allows the receiving process(es) to use
#      the corresponding environment variable.
